     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                            Example B3
                            ----------

 This example simulates schematically a Positron Emitted Tomography system.
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION

A single sphere of Depleted Uranium (DU) with diameter 1’’ serves as the geometry.
 	
 2- PHYSICS LIST

   Testing a number of physics list including:
    QGSP_BIC_HP,


 3- ACTION INITALIZATION


 4- PRIMARY GENERATOR
  
  14.1 MeV neutron are generated at a default rate of 1000 neutrons/second and sent in the direction of (1,0,0) into the sphere of DU.
   
 5- RESPONSE:  scorers

   Particles are written to a file when they cross they exit the surface of the DU Ball.

   		
 6- STACKING ACTION
 
  

 The following paragraphs are common to all basic examples

 A- VISUALISATION

   The visualization manager is set via the G4VisExecutive class
   in the main() function in exampleB3.cc.    
   The initialisation of the drawing is done via a set of /vis/ commands
   in the macro vis.mac. This macro is automatically read from
   the main function when the example is used in interactive running mode.


   For more information on visualization, including information on how to
   install and run DAWN, OpenGL and HepRApp, see the visualization tutorials,
   for example,
   http://geant4.slac.stanford.edu/Presentations/vis/G4[VIS]Tutorial/G4[VIS]Tutorial.html
   (where [VIS] can be replaced by DAWN, OpenGL and HepRApp)

   The tracks are automatically drawn at the end of each event, accumulated
   for all events and erased at the beginning of the next run.
